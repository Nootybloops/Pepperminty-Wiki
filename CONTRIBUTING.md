# Contributors guide
Contributions are very welcome - both issues and pull requests! Please mention in your pull request that you release your work under the MPL-2.0 (see below).

While Pepperminty Wiki is a huge long-time passion of mine, it may take up to 2 weeks at times for me to respond to issues and pull requests. If it has been a few days and you have not received a reply, consider joining [the Gitter/Matrix chat](https://app.gitter.im/#/room/#Pepperminty-Wiki_Lobby:gitter.im) and poking me on there.

I recommend checking on your pull request or issue every few days for a reply.

If you open a pull request, I will review your changes and reply with a review detailing some changes I would like you to make. It may take a few back and forth comments, but then once I am happy with your changes I'll accept them and merge them into the codebase. This way we can polish your contribution to make it fit in with the existing codebase better âœ¨

It is also unlikely, but possible I may reject your changes. If this is the case, I will leave a comment explaining why.

If you are no longer interested in continuing to work with a pull request or will be away for a while, please leave a comment. Nobody will be offended! If you do not leave a comment or do not respond for 2 weeks, I may take over your pull request, work on it, and merge it myself.
