# Welcome to Pepperminty Wiki!

> A Wiki in a box

Pepperminty Wiki is a complete wiki engine contained in a single file, inspired by @am2064's [Minty Wiki](https://github.com/am2064/Minty-Wiki). It's open source too (under MPL-2.0), so contributions are welcome!

Developed by Starbeamrainbowlabs (though contributions from others are welcome!), Pepperminty Wiki has a variety of useful (and cool!) features - such as file upload, a dynamic help page, page revision history, page tags, and more! Other amazing features are in the works too (like a theme gallery, auto update, and user watchlists), so check the release notes to see what's been added recently.

_This documentation is brand-new, and still a work-in-progress. If you spot any issues, please let me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/sbrl/Pepperminty-Wiki/issues/new) :-)_
